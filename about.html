    <h1>Hello! Learn a Little more About my Craft...</h1>
      <p>Ayo! I'm Emily Tran and here is my story. At 10 years old, I doodled 24/7. It was inevitable to be badged as the "art kid" in my family. I was gifted millions of sketchbooks and the same art starter kit (encased in a wooden case) every Christmas. However, this wasn't a silly, short-lived hobby. It stuck with me until my adult years. Turns out that creativity runs in my blood! I love anything related to art. I enjoy working with technology in order to make cool graphic design projects.
        Recently, I worked at TheMag at Louisiana State University. This allowed me discover my love for magazine layout and ad design. I also volunteer for improving my church's graphic designer needs, like business cards or T-shirts, which confirmed my passion for aesthetics and cohesive design. Annnd, we can't forget our family's (unpaid lol) logo requests! Symmetry and color theory are really fun too. These experiences shaped me for the professional world. I've never stopped enjoying this
        long journey of learning the skills to become a proficient graphic designer!</p>
      
      <p>PS: I love NCT (K-pop band) and cats :)</p>
