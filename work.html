        <h1>Bruce Lee Logo</h1>
        <p>The Bruce Lee logo is based on a passion project. The dragon was chosen for the logo because
        of its fierceness and his “little dragon” nickname. The logo is a geometric design based on the eastern
        dragon. Eastern dragons are snake-like, with horns and a beard. The dragon’s shape is constructed into
        his initials, the “B” and “L”.</p>
